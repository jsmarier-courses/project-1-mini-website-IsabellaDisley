        <h1>What is "Thrifting" and Where is it?</h1>
        <p>The term "thrifting" is the form of sustainable shopping on a budget. This means that you can buy name brand articles of clothing for under their retail price. This means that there is a chance of finding the same item you would find in a store for a much lower price. This concept has quickly developed a huge popularity level. There are a countless amount of locations to go thrifting in the city of Ottawa. Some examples include: The Salvation Army, Value Village and The Mission. Recently, there has been a skyrocketed amount of thrifting small businesses on the social media platform Instagram.</p>

        <h2>Instagram Vintage/Thrifting Businesses</h2>
        <p>For approximately a year, Instagram's platform has become a main source for thrifting. Online apps have also become the ideal location to thrift across Canada, and even internationally. Since the pandemic lightened up, local vintage vendors were given back the chance to organize, host and attend events in the capital. Some of these events include: The Fly Market, Midday Picnic and 613Flea. Some vendors have individually and impressively worked hard to open their own store! I was lucky enough to visit some of the markets throughout the summer!</p>

        <h2>The Markets in Ottawa</h2>
        <p>The environment of these markets are astronomical. Rain or shine, it is always an extremely fun setting to be apart of whether you're a vendor or not. There is music, people dancing and smiles all around! Vendors will greet you with a warm welcome as you step into their booth to browse. </p>
        <p>There isn't just clothing you can find and thrift at these markets. Some other unique pieces you can find include: technological gadgets such as film cameras, baked goods, jewelery and even toys for pets! Usually, the 613Flea market has the most variety of different vendors. The Midday and Fly market are specifically clothes and accessories. From purses and sunglasses, to sweatshirts and pants!</p>
